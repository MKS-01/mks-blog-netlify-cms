Step by step guide to setup your own NAS using Raspberry Pi. I have divided section
in two parts.First, how to install KALI Linux on Raspberry Pi and enable SSH for remote
access. Second parts, covers NAS configuration.

#### Prerequisite

- Raspberry Pi 3 B (One I'm using)
- Class 10 micro SD card 32 GB
- HDMI monitor, keyboard and mouse (for one time setup)
- [Kali Linux ARM Image](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/#1493408272250-e17e9049-9ce8)
- External hardisk for storage

### Section 1

#### Installation & First Boot

- Download Kali Linux Image for the Raspberry Pi
  [Kali Linux ARM Image](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/#1493408272250-e17e9049-9ce8)

- Once the image is downloaded. Flash the Image to the Micro SD Card. I used
  [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

- Time for first boot. At this point we need HDMI monitor and keyboard. Plug in the power source to boot into Kali Linux
  for the first time. To get to the desktop, default login is "root" with "toor" being the password.

- Update Kali Linux

```
sudo apt-get update &&  sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

- Once update completed. Change the root password.

```
passwd root
```

#### SSH configuration

- Change default SSH host keys

```
root@kali:~ rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
root@kali:~ dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
root@kali:~ service ssh restart
```

- Test SSH working

```
sudo service ssh status
```

- If it's not, then

```
sudo service ssh start
```

- Run the command ifconfig on Pi terminal and get the IP address from there.

```
ifconfig
```

- That't it. Now we can access Pi remotely.

```
sss root@(IP_address)
```
