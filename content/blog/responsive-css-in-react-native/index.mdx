Responsive CSS in React Native is one of the biggest pain for the developer.
As such, there is no media query support for react-native.

My approach

```JS
import {Dimensions, PixelRatio} from 'react-native';

const WINDOW_WIDTH = Dimensions.get('window').width;
const guidelineBaseWidth = 375;

export const scaleSize = (size) => (WINDOW_WIDTH / guidelineBaseWidth) * size;

export const scaleFont = (size) => size * PixelRatio.getFontScale();

```

Here, I'm measuring WINDOW WIDTH of the device on which the app is running.
And then as per the above calculation, I have declared two global functions.
scaleSize() and scaleFont() that I'm using with CSS. scaleSize() for all the
height and width related properties. And scaleFont() for font specific CSS properties.

```JS
import styled from 'styled-components/native';
import {scaleSize} from './mixins';

export const Card = styled.View`
  width: 100%;
  border: 1px solid ${(props) => props.theme.cardBorder};
  border-radius: ${scaleSize(3)}px;
  background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.cardBackground};
  padding: ${scaleSize(18)}px ${scaleSize(22)}px ${scaleSize(14)}px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: ${scaleSize(5)}px ${scaleSize(5)}px ${scaleSize(8)}px
    ${(props) => props.theme.shadowEffect};
`;
export const TextView = styled.Text`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.subText};
  font-size: ${scaleFont(15)}px;
  text-align: justify;
`;


```
